                    with very good social skills and great capacity for learning.
                    Over the past year I have discovered my passion for web and application development,
                    and I have decided to do a 180Âº spin with my life and switch the tourism industry for a career in
                    web development.
                    Iâ€™m looking forward to bringing that passion to a full-time role!

                <p className="a-p">I started as a self-taught web-developer for a couple of months, then I
                    enrolled
                    in an intense Bootcamp at Factoria F5 based in Barcelona where I learned HMTL5, CSS3, JavaScript,
                    React, SQL among others
                    while practicing and working on individual and group projects.</p>
                <p className="a-p">Being in a position to change the world with code made me realize how
                    much I wanted to work for this.
                    Makes me happy being able to create, learn, explore and think about how to make things/code better.
